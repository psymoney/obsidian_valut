# 1. Foundations
## 1-1. Basic Hardware
1) Registers:
	- built in CPU
	- used within one CPU clock cycle
2) Memory access:
	- through memory bus
	- might take many CPU clock cycle -> cause *stall*
3) Cache:
	- built in CPU
	- to boost memory access time
## 1-2. Address Binding
series of mapping between program logical and physical addresses
1) symbolic address: count as variable
2) relocatable addres: 14 bytes from the begining of this module
3) absolute address: 74014
address binding can be done at steps along the following:
#### Compile time:
- happens at compile time, if know memory address where the process will reside in -> compiler knows where the process will be located in memory in compile time
- CPU generates logical address as perspective of a program, but, it will be same as physical address as no translation is required
- if starting location changes, recompile is necessary.
- (question) conditions of compile time means that source program is the only module of the program and memory status is not requried to be translated through MMU?
#### Load time:
- if not known at compile time where the process will reside in memory, the compiler must generate relocatable code.  -> in compile time, compiler did not know where it will be located
- final binding is delayed until load time.
- if starting location changes, only reload is required for changed value.
#### Execution time
- if the process can be moved during its execution from one to another segment, then binding must be delayed until run time.
- special hardware must be available
- most OS use this method

## 1-3. Logical & Physical Addresses
- Logical address: generated by CPU
- Physical address: seen by memory unit(loaded into memory)

## 1-4. Dynamic Loading
with dynamic loading, not entire program will be loaded into memory at once, but splited into routines and only main routine is loaded into memory. only when the program requires another routines it loads the routine so that dynamic loadinig allows the system utilizes more memory space efficiently. 
- routines are stored in a relocatable load foramt
- no operating system supports required.


# 2. Memory Allocation
## 2-1. Continuous Allocation
### 2-1-1. Uni-programming
### 2-1-2. Multiprogramming
#### 1) Fixed Partition
#### 2) Variable Partition

## 2-2. Non-continuous Allocation
